# Frest Sidebar



Branch for Sidebar

## How to run:

You need to have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed to get everything setup beforehand. The docker file will automatically run everything to setup the container.

##### For those who do not have Docker Desktop:

Just simply clone / fork this repository and run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` as the Node version might not be compatible. After that, simple run `npm start`, and you are good to go.
